## Architecture

This project is built following a **Clean Architecture** approach, emphasizing separation of concerns and testability. It adopts a **modular design** with **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.

### Core Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: The architecture is organized into concentric layers, with the innermost layers being independent of the outermost layers. This ensures that business rules are not coupled to external frameworks or databases.
- **Modular Design**: The application is divided into distinct, self-contained modules (e.g., `user`, `task`), each responsible for a specific domain area. This promotes maintainability and scalability.
- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**: This pattern ensures that the application's core logic is isolated from external concerns like databases, UI, or third-party services. The core application interacts with the outside world through 'ports' (interfaces), and 'adapters' implement these ports for specific technologies.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The design focuses on a rich understanding of the domain, with concepts like Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, and Domain Services being central to the codebase.

### Layered Structure

The project's directory structure reflects its architectural layers. You will observe a distinct layering, particularly within the `shared` module and other domain-specific modules.

#### Shared Module Layers

The `shared` module, which contains common functionalities and foundational elements, is structured into three primary layers:

1.  **Domain Layer (`src/shared/domain`)**:

    This is the core of the application, containing the enterprise-wide business rules. It is independent of any external concerns. This layer includes:

    - **Entities**: Represent business objects with a distinct identity.
    - **Value Objects**: Describe characteristics of a thing.
    - **Domain Services**: Operations that don't naturally fit within an Entity or Value Object.
    - **Repositories Interfaces**: Define contracts for data persistence, without specifying implementation details.

    ```
    src/shared/domain/
    ├── exceptions/
    ├── interfaces/
    ├── models/
    └── value-objects/
    ```

2.  **Application Layer (`src/shared/application`)**:

    This layer orchestrates the domain objects to perform specific use cases. It contains application-specific business rules and depends on the Domain layer but is independent of the Infrastructure layer. This layer typically includes:

    - **Application Services**: Coordinate domain objects to fulfill use cases.
    - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used for data input and output.
    - **Queries and Commands**: Part of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern, separating read and write models.

    ```
    src/shared/application/
    ├── commands/
    ├── dtos/
    ├── queries/
    └── services/
    ```

3.  **Infrastructure Layer (`src/shared/infrastructure`)**:

    This layer deals with external concerns such as databases, external APIs, and frameworks. It implements the interfaces defined in the Domain layer. This layer includes:

    - **Persistence Implementations**: Concrete implementations of repository interfaces (e.g., TypeORM repositories for PostgreSQL).
    - **External Service Integrations**: Adapters for interacting with third-party services.
    - **Framework-specific code**: NestJS modules, providers, and controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.

    ```
    src/shared/infrastructure/
    ├── database/
    ├── openapi/
    ├── services/
    └── utils/
    ```

#### Module-Specific Gateway Layer

Beyond the `shared` module, other domain-specific modules (e.g., `user`, `task`) introduce an additional layer called `gateway`. This layer is specifically designed to handle external incoming information, primarily HTTP requests.

- **Gateway Layer (`src/[module]/v1/gateway`)**:

  This layer acts as the entry point for external interactions. It is responsible for:

  - **Request Handling**: Receiving and validating incoming HTTP requests.
  - **Data Transformation**: Converting external request data into application-layer DTOs.
  - **Response Formatting**: Transforming application-layer output into appropriate HTTP responses.
  - **API Endpoints**: Defining the routes and controllers for the module's API.

  For example, within the `user` module, you would find:

  ```
  src/user/v1/gateway/
  ├── controllers/
  ├── dtos/
  └── guards/
  ```

  This structure ensures that the core application logic remains decoupled from the specifics of the web framework, allowing for easier changes to the presentation layer if needed.

### Services Used

This project leverages several external services to provide robust and scalable functionality:

- **PostgreSQL**:

  Used as the primary relational database for storing and managing application data. It provides reliability, data integrity, and powerful querying capabilities.

  _Configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:_

  ```yaml
  postgres:
    container_name: postgres_${PROJECT_NAME}
    image: postgres:14.5-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
      - POSTGRES_ROL=${POSTGRES_ROL}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      - PGDATA=/data/postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres:/data/postgres
    ports:
      - \'${POSTGRES_PORT}:5432\'
    networks:
      - users-api
    restart: always
  ```

- **Redis**:

  Integrated for caching information from certain flows. This significantly improves response times and overall application performance by reducing the load on the primary database.

  _Configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:_

  ```yaml
  redis:
    container_name: redis-${PROJECT_NAME}
    image: bitnami/redis:6.2.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - redis:/var/lib/redis
      - redis-config:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
    ports:
      - ${REDIS_PORT}:6379
    networks:
      - users-api
  ```

- **Kafka & Zookeeper**:

  These are used to implement an **event-driven architecture**, specifically for the user creation flow. Kafka acts as a distributed streaming platform, enabling asynchronous communication and decoupling of services, while Zookeeper manages Kafka brokers.

  _Configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:_

  ```yaml
  zookeeper:
    container_name: zookeeper-${PROJECT_NAME}
    image: \'bitnami/zookeeper:3.8.0\'
    restart: always
    ports:
      - ${ZOOKEEPER_PORT}:2181
    networks:
      - users-api
    volumes:
      - kafka:/data/zookeeper
    environment:
      - ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes
  kafka:
    container_name: kafka-${PROJECT_NAME}
    image: \'bitnami/kafka:3.1.0\'
    restart: always
    ports:
      - ${KAFKA_PORT}:9092
    environment:
      - KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:${ZOOKEEPER_PORT}
      - KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:${KAFKA_PORT}
      - ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes
    networks:
      - users-api
    volumes:
      - kafka:/data/kafka
  ```

- **Swagger**:

  Used for comprehensive API documentation. Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at the `/api` endpoint. This allows developers to understand, test, and interact with the API endpoints easily.

  _Integration in `src/main.ts`:_

  ```typescript
  import { NestFactory } from \'@nestjs/core\';
  import { ConfigService } from \'@nestjs/config\';
  import { AppModule } from \'@/app.module\';
  import { SwaggerAPI } from \'@/shared/infrastructure/openapi/swagger.api\';

  async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
    const config: ConfigService = app.get(ConfigService);
    const port: number = config.get<number>(\'PORT\') || 3000;

    app.enableCors();

    SwaggerAPI.setup(app);

    await app.listen(port);
    return port;
  }

  bootstrap()
    .then((port: number) => console.log(`Application is running on port:${port}`))
    .catch((error) => console.error(\'Error starting the application:\', error));
  ```

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. A `.env` file should be created in the root directory of the project, based on the `.env.example` (if available) or the variables used in `docker-compose.yml` and the application code. Below are the key environment variables identified:

- `PROJECT_NAME`: Name of the project, used for naming Docker containers.
- `PROJECT_PORT`: Port on which the NestJS application will run.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name for PostgreSQL.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: Username for PostgreSQL database access.
- `POSTGRES_ROL`: Role for PostgreSQL database access.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Password for PostgreSQL database access.
- `POSTGRES_PORT`: Port for PostgreSQL database.
- `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`: Default email for pgAdmin login.
- `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`: Default password for pgAdmin login.
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Password for Redis.
- `REDIS_PORT`: Port for Redis.
- `REDIS_COMMANDER_USER`: Username for Redis Commander.
- `REDIS_COMMANDER_PASSWORD`: Password for Redis Commander.
- `ZOOKEEPER_PORT`: Port for Zookeeper.
- `KAFKA_PORT`: Port for Kafka.

It is crucial to configure these variables correctly for the application and its services to function as expected.
